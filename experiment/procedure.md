### 1. Collection of Organic Waste

Organic materials such as kitchen waste, animal dung, agricultural residues, and sewage sludge are collected and brought to the plant.

### 2. Pre-treatment (if required)

The collected waste may be chopped, diluted with water, or filtered to remove non-biodegradable materials. This improves the efficiency of digestion.

### 3. Feeding into the Digester

The prepared slurry is fed into the biodigester tank, which is an airtight container made of concrete, steel, or plastic.

### 4. Anaerobic Digestion

Inside the biodigester, **anaerobic bacteria** (bacteria that work without oxygen) break down the organic matter in several stages:

* **Hydrolysis:** Complex organic compounds break into simpler molecules.
* **Acidogenesis:** Simple molecules convert to volatile fatty acids.
* **Acetogenesis:** Fatty acids convert to acetic acid, hydrogen, and CO₂.
* **Methanogenesis:** Methanogenic bacteria produce methane (CH₄) and CO₂.

This process takes **15–30 days**, depending on the temperature and material.

### 5. Biogas Collection

Biogas, a mixture of methane (\~60–70%), carbon dioxide, and trace gases, accumulates in the gas chamber or dome above the slurry. It is piped out and used for cooking, heating, or electricity generation.

### 6. Slurry Outlet

The leftover digested material, called **bioslurry**, exits through an outlet. This is rich in nutrients and can be used as **organic fertilizer**.

### 7. Gas Utilization and Storage

The collected gas can be:
<br>Burned directly for heat/cooking.
<br>Used in biogas generators for electricity.
<br>Stored in gas bags or cylinders for later use.
