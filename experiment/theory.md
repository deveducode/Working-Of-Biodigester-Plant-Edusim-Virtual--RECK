### Theory of Working of a Biodigester Plant

A biodigester plant operates on the principle of **anaerobic digestion**, a biological process where microorganisms break down organic waste (such as food waste, animal manure, or agricultural residues) in the absence of oxygen. This decomposition results in the production of two key outputs:

1. **Biogas** – a combustible mixture mainly of methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂), which can be used as a renewable energy source.
2. **Digestate** – a nutrient-rich slurry that can be used as organic fertilizer.

#### Key Stages in the Process:

1. **Feeding**: Organic materials are collected and introduced into the biodigester tank.
2. **Anaerobic Digestion**: Inside the sealed tank, bacteria decompose the biomass in a series of stages: hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis.
3. **Gas Collection**: Biogas rises to the top of the tank and is stored for use as fuel.
4. **Slurry Discharge**: The remaining digestate is periodically removed and used as fertilizer.



### Construction of a Biodigester Plant (Working-Based)

The construction of a biodigester plant is designed to support the anaerobic digestion process efficiently. It consists of several key components arranged to enable the collection, digestion, and utilization of organic waste and resulting biogas.

#### **1. Inlet Chamber (Feeding Unit):**

* A funnel or pipe through which organic waste (kitchen waste, animal dung, etc.) is fed into the digester.
* Connected to a mixing tank where waste is mixed with water for easier flow and decomposition.

#### **2. Digester Tank (Anaerobic Chamber):**

* A large airtight cylindrical or dome-shaped tank made of concrete, bricks, or steel.
* Acts as the primary fermentation unit where anaerobic digestion takes place.
* Maintains a constant temperature (mesophilic or thermophilic range) to support microbial activity.

#### **3. Gas Holder or Dome:**

* Placed above or integrated into the digester.
* Collects biogas produced during digestion.
* May be fixed (dome type) or floating depending on the plant design.
* Outlet pipe connected to gas appliances or storage units.

#### **4. Slurry Outlet (Effluent Chamber):**

* An outlet through which decomposed slurry exits the digester.
* Slurry is often collected in a separate pit for drying or direct application to fields as fertilizer.

#### **5. Support Structures:**

* Valves, pipes, and pressure regulators for gas flow.
* Stirring mechanism (in some plants) for even digestion.
* Insulation for temperature control in colder climates.
