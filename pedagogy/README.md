<b> Experiment| Working of Biodigester Plant   <b> 


<h4> [1. Focus Area](#LO)A biodigester takes things like food scraps and animal manure and, with the help of tiny living things (microbes) that don't need oxygen, turns them into two useful products: biogas (a renewable energy source) and bio-fertilizer (which is great for plants).
<h4> [2. Learning Objectives ](#LOLearners will be able to explain the basic working principles of a biodigester plant, identify key inputs and outputs, and understand its environmental benefits.
<h4> [3. Instructional Strategy](#IS)Input & Mixing: Introduce the concept of feeding organic waste (manure, food scraps) into a sealed tank and mixing it with water. <br>Anaerobic Digestion: Explain that beneficial microorganisms break down this waste in the absence of oxygen.<br>Biogas Production: Highlight the primary output: biogas, composed mainly of methane and carbon dioxide.<br>Effluent Output: Point out the other output: nutrient-rich digestate (slurry) which can be used as fertilizer.<br>Collection & Utilization: Describe how biogas is collected for energy (cooking, electricity) and the digestate is used as fertilizer.
<h4> [4. Task & Assessment Questions](#AQ)Tasks: <br> Feedstock Input: Organic waste (like animal dung, food scraps, agricultural residue) is fed into the digester.<br>Anaerobic Digestion: Inside the sealed digester tank, microorganisms break down the organic matter in the absence of oxygen.<br>Biogas Production: This breakdown process produces biogas, primarily methane and carbon dioxide.<br>Biogas Collection: The generated biogas rises and is collected at the top of the digester or in a separate storage unit.<br>Effluent Output (Digestate): The remaining digested material, called digestate, is discharged from the plant.<br>Energy/Fertilizer Use: The biogas can be used for cooking, heating, or electricity generation, while the digestate serves as a nutrient-rich fertilizer.<br><br>
Assessment: <br> What is the primary condition required for the decomposition of organic matter inside a biodigester?<br> Which two gases are the primary components of biogas produced in a biodigester?<br>What is the main use of the digestate (the remaining material) discharged from a biodigester plant?
