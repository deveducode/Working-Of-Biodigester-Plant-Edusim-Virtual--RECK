### About the Experiment 

This virtual lab simulates the working of a biodigester plant, which converts organic waste into biogas through the process of anaerobic digestion. The experiment allows users to visualize each stage of the biodigesterâ€” from waste input, microbial decomposition, to biogas and slurry output. It helps learners understand the biological and chemical processes involved, the role of temperature and pH, and how biogas is used as a renewable energy source. This interactive simulation aids in promoting environmental awareness and the practical application of sustainable waste management.
